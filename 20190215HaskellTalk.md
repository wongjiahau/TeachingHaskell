<h1 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h1>
<p>Imagine your boss tells you to create a <em>Shape Evaluator</em> program.</p>
<p>The <em>Shape Evaluator</em> is a very simple program.</p>
<p>First, it will read a file named <code>shape.txt</code> which has the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>Circle 3
Square 2
Rectangle 3 4
Rectangle 9 9
Circle 4
NULL
</code></pre>
<p>Then, it will perform the following task:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print the area of each shape, for example (note that the number of decimal places in not important):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>28.27
4
12
81
50.26
0
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Count the number of each shape and print the result, for example (note that the ordering is not important):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Circle 2
Square 1
Rectangle 2
NULL 1
</code></pre>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can use any programming languages you want.</li>
<li>You may choose to do this alone or do it as a team with your friends</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extra-things">Extra things</h2>
<p>Your code should be easily extendable, because in the future, your boss might want to add new shapes, so be careful on how you model your data and write your code.</p>
